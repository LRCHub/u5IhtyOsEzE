A teenager's dream is on the scene
The Camera to blows your mind
Drop the weight for goodness sakes
To make the cover just on time
Leave your excess baggage
On the carousel
You won't be staying long enough
For anyone to tell

A little bit crazy but you get back by
And no one seems to care what's on your mind

You don't know you're right from wrong
But you know you're half way gone
In a negative fashion

So much more to be
In every star there is a sun
Baby you know you're the one
In a negative fashion

So much more to see
You don't have to answer to anyone
All that is left for you is what you've become

Coz after all the bullshit that you've been through
You don't need all the lights to shine for you

You don't know you're right from wrong
But you know you're half way gone
In a negative fashion

So much more to be
Every star there is a sun
Baby you know you're the one
In a negative fashion

So much more to see
You don't have to answer to anyone
All you need is watch you having fun
Now let's left coz just beyond all that door

Woo
